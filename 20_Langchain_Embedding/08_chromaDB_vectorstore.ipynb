Maintaining proper table etiquette at formal or semi-formal events like weddings can make a strong, positive impression. Here are some key points to keep in mind:\\n\\nüçΩ Basic Table Etiquette to Maintain at Events:\\n1. Handling Food & Eating:\\nUse Cutlery Properly: Always use the fork and knife as intended. Cut your food into bite-sized pieces instead of stuffing large pieces into your mouth.\\n\\nDon‚Äôt Chew with Your Mouth Open: Always chew with your mouth closed to avoid making unnecessary sounds.\\n\\nAvoid Eating with Your Hands: Unless it's a finger food event or explicitly allowed (like BBQ or African dishes meant to be eaten by hand), always use cutlery.\\n\\nDon‚Äôt Lick Fingers or Pick Teeth: Use napkins to clean your fingers and a toothpick discreetly if necessary (preferably after leaving the table).\\n\\nFinish Chewing Before Speaking: It shows respect and makes conversation more pleasant for everyone.\\n\\n2. Handling Drinks:\\nHold Glasses Properly: Wine glasses should be held by the stem, not the bowl.\\n\\nAvoid Slurping: Sip drinks quietly.\\n\\nPace Yourself: Don‚Äôt drink too fast, especially if alcohol is being served.\\n\\n3. Table Interaction:\\nWait for Everyone Before Starting: In formal settings, it‚Äôs polite to wait until everyone has been served before you start eating.\\n\\nEngage in Polite Conversation: Keep topics friendly, light, and positive.\\n\\nAvoid Using Your Phone: Unless it's absolutely necessary, keep your phone away to show respect to those around you.\\n\\n4. Serving Etiquette:\\nPassing Dishes: Always pass dishes to your right.\\n\\nDon‚Äôt Reach Over Others: Politely ask for dishes to be passed to you.\\n\\nServing Yourself: Take reasonable portions, especially when it‚Äôs a buffet or shared meal.\\n\\n5. Handling Bones (Like Chicken Bones):\\nDon‚Äôt Chew Bones at Formal Events: As funny as your friend‚Äôs situation was, it's considered bad etiquette to gnaw on bones. If you accidentally get a bone in your food, discreetly remove it with your fork and place it on the side of your plate.\\n\\nAvoid Sucking or Crunching Bones: Save that for more casual settings where it‚Äôs culturally acceptable.\\n\\n6. Finishing Your Meal:\\nPlace Cutlery Properly: When you‚Äôre done eating, place your knife and fork diagonally across your plate (fork tines down, knife blade inward) to signal you‚Äôre finished.\\n\\nThanking the Host: Always thank the host for the meal and the invitation before leaving.\\n\\nYou‚Äôre already socially intelligent, so you probably follow most of these without even thinking about it. üòÑ It‚Äôs good you tried to correct your friend in a playful way, though.\\n\\nWould you like me to show you how to handle those situations more smoothly when your friends act out of etiquette in public events? üòä And by the way, how did your friend defend himself? \")]"
